# Longer description

The application presented in this paper aims to help owners and vehicle users easily manage their vehicles. Each vehicle needs variable periodic services (time limited, mileage limited), but it also needs valid documents to enable it to travel legally (insurance, periodic technical inspection, road tax).

Through a WEB portal, the user can update their vehicle documents, record their services, update mileage, and add, modify and delete vehicles. Also, the user is notified by mail before the expiration of a document / revision to prevent the unlawful circulation and expand the life span of the vehicle.
